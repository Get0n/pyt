# 1) The program introduces itself as a digital assistant and displays its name.
assistant_name = "BingBot"  # Store the name in a variable
print(f"Greetings, Padawan. My name is {assistant_name}.\n")

# 2) The program displays information about Systems Analysis and Design.
singleVariable = "Systems Analysis and Design is to learn different techniques for building systems more effectively and efficiently."
print(singleVariable + "\n")

# 3) The program displays information about the Software (or System) Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
differentVariable = "The Software (or System) Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach that breaks the software process into phases--planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance."
print(differentVariable + "\n")

# 4) The program prints a transition statement.
print("Well, that is enough about SDLC! Let's talk more about me!\n")

# 5) The program displays its favorite number and the reason it is their favorite number.
favoriteNumberVariable = 42  # Store the favorite number in a variable
print(f"I'm so happy that you are here to learn more about me. Do you know that {favoriteNumberVariable} is my favorite number. I also like unicorns and dragons.\n")

# 6) The program creates story lines about how certain numbers produce the favorite number.
print(f"When you add 40 green dragons and 2 blue dragons you get {favoriteNumberVariable} dragons. And when you subtract 50 unicorns and 8 unicorns you get {favoriteNumberVariable} unicorns. Isn't that cool? What is even better.....\n")

# 7) The program verifies the math is correct by displaying the Python lines that produce the results of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
print(f"print(40+2) displays {40+2}")
print(f"print(50-8) displays {50-8}\n")

# 8) The program says its final goodbye and displays its name as it exits.
print(f"It was so much fun having you to talk to today. I hope we can continue to talk in the future, Padawan. {assistant_name} is at your service. Have a good and blessed day!")
